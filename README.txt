# Image Seam Carving

A simple playground to implement image seam carving asfalse described here:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seam_carving

**Disclaimer:** This is a just for fun playground of mine, where I implement
the seam carving algorithm in rust just for fun, without a specific use case in
mind. Maybe it is useful for others as well, therefore it is available. It is
neither specifically well designed nor very optimized.
